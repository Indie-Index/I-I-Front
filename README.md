# INDIE-INDEX

This project is for a website to display different design principles for game development.  It is the brain child of the excellent designer Otto Awqatty and brought to life by the developers Bill Novak (@novakw267) and Daniel Sweetser (@dsweetser).  Sure, it's not currently much to look at but we'll get there!

## Starter Code

Starter code for this project was taken from [this repo](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/ember-resources).
